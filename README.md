html stuff
this is an html site that i am building and learning, but this seems to me that it could be a lot easier than having to do all the stuff, i could just go <p> hello world</p>
also, an unrelated point... but does anyone know of any microcontrollers that are programmable with a HDMI or color TV output that is either html, drag and drop or python programmed? (like a micro:bit with SD/HD/4K color display or HDMI) 
thanks for reading/helping me.
